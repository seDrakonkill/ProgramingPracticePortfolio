Necessary Parts: 

UI, Functional Functions, Icon

Step 1. 
	Will be learning how to make UI. I want to have it be a square window, with all the calculator number keys being different colors. There will be the basic math functions + a few more (Logs, Squares, Roots of various powers)
	The program will have the regular maximize, minimize, close buttons. The maximize will not change the aspect ratio.

Step 2. 
	Make sure the functions can Add, Subtract, Multiply, Divide, square, square root, log. They should take 2 parameters
	They will return a float or a double (not sure the difference as of this time). That float will be stored for use as the first variable in the next operation (assuming the user hits a function button before typing in a new number)

Step 3. 
	Make sure the buttons on the calculator work as expected. 

Step 4. Make a special Icon for it, and have that open the program from the desk top.
